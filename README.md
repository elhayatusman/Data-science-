🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Model using Linear Regression
Welcome to the Rainfall Prediction Model project — a simple yet effective machine learning solution for forecasting rainfall patterns using Linear Regression. This project was built as part of an undergraduate research project in Computer Science, and it demonstrates how historical climate data can be transformed into meaningful predictions to support agriculture, disaster management, and environmental planning.

🚀 What This Project Does
	•	Predicts 1-month and 3-month rainfall anomalies.
	•	Uses key climatic features like 10-day rainfall, rolling rainfall averages, and anomalies.
	•	Built with scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.
	•	Evaluated using MAE and R² for performance tracking.

📊 Model Performance

Model	MAE	R² Score
1-Month	16.92	0.95
3-Month	37.10	0.97

🧰 Tech Stack
